"# ICOProject" 

We'll do a simple cashier system like in the supermarket that uses scanner and monitor as I/O devices.

Coding aspect:
1. Faisal creates simple arrays that contain information about the products. Only 5 products will do (contain: product_id, product_name, price etc)

2. Aiman creates a greeting screen when the user launches the code, make it beautiful and systematically placed

3. Nazhan creates a method where when a user scans the product barcode aka product id(we just enter using keyboard during presentation), it'll automatically shows the product name, and the price. [Input device explains][Interrupt function explains]

4. Taufiq creates a method where the total prices of the items that have been scanned will be totaled and return to main method

5. Afnan take the returned total value and shows the total product and total prices for the whole purchase and display on screen [Output deviceÂ explains]
